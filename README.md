# Projects Portfolio Website

This is a website containing 3 webpages which cover all the projects which I have worked on previously or currently uploaded to GitHub and acts as a portfolio for employers and other people to view.

<br>

I have developed using the following languages/frameworks:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript.

<br>

Current Functionalities:

- Home page containing basic overall information regarding me
- Popup upon first visit through the use of a cookie system using JavaScript
- Projects page containing all projects and links to GitHub repos
- Contact Me page containing contact information and links to GitHub and Sending Email
- Responsive website design for all Desktop resolutions through the use of viewport width.

<br>

Future planned Functionalities:

- Mobile-friendly website layout.

**DISCLAIMER: Website may be unstable due to inadequate experience using the mentioned languages, report any issues/bugs with the website in the repo issues section.**
