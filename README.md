# Projects Portfolio Website

## Description

This is a website containing 3 webpages which cover all the projects which I have worked on previously or currently uploaded to GitHub and acts as a portfolio for employers and other people to view.

## Development Process

I started developing this project from scratch, without the use of any HTML, CSS or JS frameworks. I plan to incrementally add more features to the website as I gain more web development experience and acquire more projects.

## Deployed Demo

**[Hosted Static Website Link](https://www.devpinda.dev/index.html)**

## Language Stack

**I have developed using the following languages:**

**- [HTML](https://github.com/DevPinda/Projects-Portfolio-Website/blob/main/index.html)**
**- [CSS](https://github.com/DevPinda/Projects-Portfolio-Website/tree/main/Styling)**
**- [JS](https://github.com/DevPinda/Projects-Portfolio-Website/tree/main/Scripts)**

## Features

**Current Functionalities:**

- **Home page** containing basic overall information regarding me and tech stacks I have worked with
- **Popup** upon first visit through the use of a **cookie system** using **JavaScript** that notifies the website is designed for Desktop resolutions
- **Projects page** containing projects and links to GitHub repos
- **Contact Me page** containing contact information and links to GitHub and Sending Email
- Responsive website design for all Desktop resolutions through the use of viewport width to scale website elements
- **Interactive website design**, with the use of CSS animations in conjunction with hover effects and JavaScript to make the website more interactive for the user

**Future planned Functionalities:**

- **Mobile-friendly website layout**, as it is currently only responsive for Desktop resolutions
